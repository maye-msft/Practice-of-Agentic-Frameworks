# Practices of Agentic Frameworks

## Introduction

AI Agent is an intelligent agent that uses large language models, combined with existing knowledge bases, APIs, and the coding capabilities of large language models. It has been proven that these intelligent agents can help us complete some complex tasks.

With the popularity of intelligent agents, in order to simplify their development, some open-source frameworks have emerged in the open-source community. Here we introduce some of the open-source frameworks and provide examples of common scenarios.


- [Promptflow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/)
    > Prompt flow is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

- [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
    > AutoGen is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AutoGen aims to provide an easy-to-use and flexible framework for accelerating development and research on agentic AI, like PyTorch for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents that can converse with other agents, LLM and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.s

- [TaskWeaver](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/)
    > TaskWeaver is a code-first agent framework for seamlessly planning and executing data analytics tasks. This innovative framework interprets user requests through coded snippets and efficiently coordinates a variety of plugins in the form of functions to execute data analytics or workflow automation tasks.

 We will demonstrate the development practices of these frameworks in 
 - Chatbot
-  Function invocation
 - Task flow orchestration
 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)
 - Code generation and execution
